# GLaDOS's Gambit

## Description: 
Oh good, another test subject. I've prepared a simple chess evaluation chamber. My neural networks suggest even a human of your... limited cognitive capacity should be able to determine the correct sequence of moves. And don't worry - unlike the last subject, you won't be eligible for immediate neurotoxin exposure upon failure. Probably.

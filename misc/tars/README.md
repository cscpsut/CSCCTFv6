# Hey TARS?

## Description: 
Apparently Dr. Brand left some crucial space-time coordinates in this puzzle because USB drives don't exist in space. TARS (75% humor) will help you piece it together, assuming you don't mess up as badly as Dr. Mann did.

Warning: May or may not actually bend space-time. Side effects include temporal displacement and dad jokes.

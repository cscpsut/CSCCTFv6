# writer writeup 
The player is given a `.GBA` file this is a Game-Boy-Advanced file, it contains a popular game called:
**Pokemon Emerald**

in order to run it they will need an emulator like:
1. My boy advanced
2. mGBA

after the game launched successfully, they will need to inspect the game files and see if there is anything unusual, in order to do this they have to download the original ROM file, and compare between the two to see if there is anything new, after doing so they will find a new map created by the writer (its not part of the original game), they can use tools such as:

* Advanced Map
after doing so they will need to understand how the events in the game works, in order to reach this hidden map, 

now to solve the challenge there are two ways:
1. find the hidden map and a hidden NPC, then defeat it to get the flag
2. reverse the script assigned to the NPC to get the flag directly

**Flag: CSCCTF{4dd_my_n4m3_70_y0ur_l157_0f_w34kn35535}**

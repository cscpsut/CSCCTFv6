1. Idenitfy the database type using sqlmap, or through manual testing.
2. View the `sqlite_master` table to see the structure of the database, where you will find a view called secret_view with the flag redacted.
3. Use the injectable interactive route to create a new table, then repeat the same inject with a `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement to copy the flag from the secret_view to the new table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE 1=1; CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT * FROM secret_view;
```

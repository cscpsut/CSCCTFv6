A powerful and dangerous malware, known as "Dragon Flash", has been discovered on a friend's device, and all signs point to a chilling connection to the infamous Pablo Escobar. The infection originated from a flash drive, rumored to hold remnants of Escobarâ€™s era. Investigators suspect the malware is not only a cyber weapon but also a relic of his shadowy operations, possibly re-emerging in a modern form.

Your task as a digital forensic investigator is to analyze the infected system, and find the following 3 main points:

1. The malicious process PID.
2. The name of the victim's user account.
3. The original name of the Malicious process.

# Description:
Nintendo was gearing up for an exciting new game launch when disaster struck, a breach compromised their network, leading to the theft of critical game files. After a thorough investigation, the incident was traced back to the workstation of a newly hired Software Development Engineering intern.

During questioning, the intern confessed to using a script from a GitHub repository to automate a task they didnâ€™t fully understand. Eager to impress and afraid to admit their lack of knowledge on their first assignment, they used the script without consulting anyone or verifying its source. This lapse in judgment gave an attacker the foothold they needed to infiltrate the company's network.

Your mission is to investigate this breach, which began on January 6th, to uncover how the malicious script was used and how it led to unauthorized access. Analyze the logs, trace the attacker's actions, and piece together the sequence of events that compromised Nintendo's network.

Good luck, investigator!

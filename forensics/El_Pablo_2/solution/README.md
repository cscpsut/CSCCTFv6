1. If you investigated part 1 well, you would find this reg key value. (regkey="SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\RUN")
2. Once you enter the disk and navigate to "SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\RUN", you would find something else suspicious there, a powershell line that is trying to create and modify a registery key.
`powershell.exe -Command "New-Item -Path 'HKLM:\\\\System\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Control\\\\KeyboardLayout' -Force; New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\\\\System\\\\ControlSet001\\\\Control\\\\KeyboardLayout' -Name 'KeyboardLayoutUpdate' -Value 'powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\keyboard_update.ps1' -PropertyType String"`
3. You go and investigate whats going on at HKLM:\\System\\ControlSet001\\Control\\KeyboardLayout, you would find there are 2 Keyboard layout files, but one is legitemate with space between the words like it should be and the other as one word "KeyboardLayout" which is suspicious, so you check it out and find a string encoeded in base64, you decode it and find it that its an obfuscated powershell script.
4. You can deobfuscate the obfuscated powershell script using https://github.com/Malandrone/PowerDecode, run the deobfuscated it on powershell and get the flag.

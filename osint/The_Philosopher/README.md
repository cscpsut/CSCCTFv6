# The Philosopher

## Description
My buddy won’t stop rambling about this new thing called blockchain and something he calls 'Web3'. Says it’s going to change the internet forever. He’s so into it that he’s started calling himself Chainphilosopher like some kind of digital-age philosopher. The guy even wrote a long-winded post on a blog site explaining all this tech mumbo-jumbo. Oh, and he keeps bragging about making a fortune from 'crypto', whatever that is. I’m not buying it, though. If I could just get his wallet address or whatever he’s using, I’d check his balance and see if he’s actually made money or just blowing smoke. I need to find **three things** to help me prove his lie, which are the following:

1. His Wallet address.
2. Identify the wallet address that he interacted with in his first crypto transaction.
3. The name of the token that he has.
